/**
Base class for all Breeze enumerations, such as EntityState, DataType, FetchStrategy, MergeStrategy etc.
A Breeze Enum is a namespaced set of constant values.  Each Enum consists of a group of related constants, called 'symbols'.
Unlike enums in some other environments, each 'symbol' can have both methods and properties.
>     class DayOfWeek extends BreezeEnum {
>       dayIndex: number;
>       isWeekend?: boolean;
>       nextDay() {
>         let nextIndex = (this.dayIndex + 1) % 7;
>         return DayOfWeek.getSymbols()[nextIndex];
>       }
>
>       static Monday = new DayOfWeek( { dayIndex: 0});
>       static Tuesday = new DayOfWeek( { dayIndex: 1 });
>       static Wednesday = new DayOfWeek( { dayIndex: 2 });
>       static Thursday = new DayOfWeek( { dayIndex: 3 });
>       static Friday = new DayOfWeek( { dayIndex: 4 });
>       static Saturday = new DayOfWeek( { dayIndex: 5, isWeekend: true });
>       static Sunday = new DayOfWeek( { dayIndex: 6, isWeekend: true });
>     }
>
>     describe("DayOfWeek", () => {
>       test("should support full enum capabilities", function() {
>         // // custom methods
>         let dowSymbols = DayOfWeek.getSymbols();
>         expect(dowSymbols.length).toBe(7);
>         expect(DayOfWeek.Monday.nextDay()).toBe(DayOfWeek.Tuesday);
>         expect(DayOfWeek.Sunday.nextDay()).toBe(DayOfWeek.Monday);
>       // // custom properties
>         expect(DayOfWeek.Tuesday.isWeekend).toBe(undefined);
>         expect(DayOfWeek.Saturday.isWeekend).toBe(true);
>       // // Standard enum capabilities
>         expect(DayOfWeek.Thursday instanceof DayOfWeek).toBe(true);
>         expect(BreezeEnum.isSymbol(DayOfWeek.Wednesday)).toBe(true);
>         expect(DayOfWeek.contains(DayOfWeek.Thursday)).toBe(true);
>         expect(DayOfWeek.Friday.toString()).toBe("Friday");
>       });
>   });
Note that we have Error['x'] = ... in some places in the code to prevent Terser from optimizing out some important calls.
